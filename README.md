### Correlation Coefficient

* The averaged winning rates have a moderate positive correlation with attendance (r=0.56, Pearson correlation coefficient).
  
### Regression Analysis

* The r-squared is 0.31.
  
### Paird T-test
The averaged winning rates from 2015-2019 were significantly higher (t-test, p = 0.03) in squad NYCFC than squad Atlanta.

### Summary and Limitation
The correlation result suggests that the averaged winning rates are related to the attendance. 
The regression line indicates a tendency that the higher the attendace, the higher the winning rates. The result is similar to a previous study which showed that attendace has the potential to increase winning percentage in MLB (Woltring and Alabama, 2018). However, the regression equation suggests that there is no prediction tendency with the averaged winning rates and attendance. In conclusion, more potential variables will be needed to predict the next MLS champion.
